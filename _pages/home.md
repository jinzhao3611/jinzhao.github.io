### New SemEval-2022 Task for Competence-based Multimodal Question Answering
Our new SemEval-2022 [task description paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.176.pdf) just came out! 
Check [here](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34056) for more details about the task and the accompanying R2VQ dataset.

### Designing Multimodal Datasets for NLP Challenges
I am working on building R2VQ, a dataset designed for testing competence-based comprehension of machines over a multimodal recipe collection.
Check out [here](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34056) for more information.
### Semantic Visualization of Scientific Data
I am working on the exploration of the Covid-19 literature through semantic visualization. Check out
our [SemViz](https://www.semviz.org/) web page for the latest work!
